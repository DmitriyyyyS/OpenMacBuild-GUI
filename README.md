Welcome to the OpenMacBuild-GUI project for macOS!
  
In this project, an excellent program is being developed that will help you save your time, and as you already understood by the name, it has a graphical interface.

The program is adapted to work both with a light theme and with a [dark](https://github.com/DmitriyyyyS/OpenMacBuild-GUI/blob/master/Other/Logo/2.png) one.

The program has built-in mechanisms that save files from an unsettled place, for example, if you forgot where to [save](https://github.com/DmitriyyyyS/OpenMacBuild-GUI/blob/master/Other/Logo/4.jpg) the files, the program will tell you about it, or you specified the save location where you have [no write](https://github.com/DmitriyyyyS/OpenMacBuild-GUI/blob/master/Other/Logo/5.jpg) permissions.

The entire list of files that the program at this moment can provide you, but this is not the final number, the program is developing and I will add more files with versions.
